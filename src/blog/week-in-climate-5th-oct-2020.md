## The Good News
* China “aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060”. Although that’s still a lot of emissions yet to come it is still a huge target for the largest pollutor in the world. The before in that sentence is also crucial, they will be hoping for better.

* UK Prime Minister has set out a plan to raise its target for offshore wind power capacity from 30 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts by 2030. Take the “power every home” statement with a pinch of salt though, that’s based on current home electricity use which is likely to double as we need to move to electric heating (heat pumps over boilers) and electric vehicles.

* The US energy sectors largest greenhouse gas emitter, Vistra, has announced it will be closing it’s remaining 7 coal plants and sets a target of net zero by 2050.https://www.sierraclub.org/articles/2020/10/biggest-climate-polluter-makes-biggest-coal-retirement-announcement-ever

## The Bad News
* The UK are installing record numbers of polluting gas boilers instead of commiting to low-carbon, energy efficient heat pumps.

* The UK is set to open it’s first coal mine in 30 years. Apparently now placed on hold due to pressure from the environmental community, this coal mine is designed for supply to the steel and chemical industries. Focusing on cleaner future solutions for steel manufacture as well as recycling steel which doesn’t require coal makes much more sense than investing in new coal mines in 2020.

## The Conversation
* “A Life On Our Planet”, the latest documentary from British national treasure David Attenborough is one of his most powerful yet, this time on Netflix. General consensus from the community is it’s mostly excellent but not without some strong critisism to certain aspects (see next point!)

* As above, David Attenborough’s ‘A Life On Our Planet’ is a mostly excellent new documentary on Netflix but it’s framing on population is controversial. This is a great counter-piece on how and why simply blaming the population figure is wrong.
